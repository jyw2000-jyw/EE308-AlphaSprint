2. Development Time Span: 2022.4-2022.7

4. Development Language: Python, wxml, JavaScript 
5. Main Functions: **The Mini Program can recommend the users favored project based on the searching history of them**

What I want to say: Recommendation system has always been a technical area that I have been interested in, so I took the opportunity to make improvements in this project. Through independent learning, I have referred to many professional documents and materials. But I can only achieve the current level due to my limited ability. I hope I can make more progress in the future!
